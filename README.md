# About

Hello world :earth_asia:! Are you into mathematics and computer programming? Then Project Euler is a good platform for you. Click [here](https://projecteuler.net/about) to see what is Project Euler. They say the users are allowed to share and discuss the first 100 problems outside of their platform.
So here I am. :sunglasses:

# Run

The `project_euler.py` file can be used as a module, which consists of the problems and answers. Below is the example when you do this on the console:

```python
>>> from project_euler import ProjectEuler
>>> project_euler = ProjectEuler() # assign object
>>> project_euler.problem_one(1000) # solve problem one
233168
>>> project_euler.problem_two() # solve problem two
4613732
```

If instead you want to run the unit test (`test_project_euler.py`), you can just do the following:

```
python3 test_project_euler.py
```

If passed, it will show the following result:

```
